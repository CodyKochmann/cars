#### from dmv.com for south dakota cross state title transfers

```
When is an out-of-state car title transfer necessary in South Dakota?
An out of state car title transfer must be performed when South Dakota residents purchase motor vehicles from out of the state or when nonresidents move to the state with vehicles titled by another state. However, motorists should keep in mind that a title transfer is only necessary if a vehicle was previously titled in another state. Therefore, if you have purchased a vehicle from an out of state dealership and only have a certificate of origin, you will be required to apply for a brand new SD car title, rather than a car title transfer.

In addition, you will need to transfer an out of state car title if you receive a vehicle as a gift or through an inheritance. In these cases, you will need to provide proof that you are the new owner of the vehicle along with other important documents in order to successfully transfer a title. These documents can include a will and testament that names you as the new owner, or just a title transfer form that indicates the vehicle was given to you.

Information and Documents Needed for an Out-of-State Title Transfer in South Dakota
The process of transferring an out of state car title in South Dakota requires vehicle owners to prepare a list of necessary documents and submit them to the SD DMV for a title transfer to take place. Therefore, motorists may need to prepare the following documents needed for an out of state title transfer:

A completed application for a South Dakota vehicle title and registration
Current out-of-state vehicle title
Payment for the applicable fees and taxes
Note that in addition to the outlined out of state title transfer paperwork motorists may have to provide other documents, depending on their specific situation. For example, motorists who have purchased a titled vehicle from out of the state will need to provide a bill of sale to prove a transaction took place, as well as a document that proves the original owner signed over the title.

Are you planning on driving a vehicle into Mexico and leaving it for a long period of time? You may want to consider registering your vehicle with South Dakota license plates. South Dakota does not require yearly emissions testing. It is a very simple and quick process.

To get started, fill out a MV608 Title Application from Clay County, South Dakota's website. Here is the link to get the form. http://www.claycountysd.org/userfiles/files/Treasurer's%20forms/MV608.pdf 

Mail the form along with a copy of your driver's license, copy of your social security card, title of the vehicle you are registering and a Bill of Sale. You will pay 4% sales tax. Once they receive your documents, it usually takes 2-3 days to process. They will mail you 2 new plates and your registration card to your home in the USA. You will attach one plate to the front of the vehicle and the other to the back. If you have any questions, I suggest calling Clay County Treasurer's office in South Dakota at 605-677-7123 or visit their website at http://www.claycountysd.org/treasurersoffice.cfm
